Introit Tone 6 is the most strange, because it has a 3 syllable intonation for the termination, and this needs to be cut if the termination isn't long enough.
The intonation of the termination of tone 6 changes based on the accentuation:
  If the 2nd syllable is accented, it begins h hj (see 1012, 1200, 1924 of liber.pdf)
  If the 3rd syllable is accented, it begins f gh hj (see 658, 1171, 1264 of liber.pdf) as I have written below.
  If the 4th syllable is accented, it begins f gh h hj (see 506 of liber.pdf)
